Files related to getting the Tux-Lab thermoforming machine back up and running.

## controls/AcrylicRelayPanel

Files for laser-cutting the relay panel and the toggle switches panel

## pi_touch_ui

The initial goal is to get the machine up and running with manual toggle switches. But being the tinkerer type - we know we will want to do more. This respository starts with an effort to create a machine control UI with PyQt5. The idea is to mount a Raspberry Pi the machine and control the machine this way.
