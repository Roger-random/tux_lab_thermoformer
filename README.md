# Tux-Lab Thermoforming Machine project

Our first goal for the Tux-Lab thermoforming machine is to just get it up and running with manual toggle switches.
But being the tinkerer type - we know we will want to do more. This respository starts with an effort to create
a machine control UI with PyQt5. The idea is to mount a Raspberry Pi the machine and control the machine this way.
